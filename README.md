# Hello!

This is my personal page that displays some of the projects I've done.

## What's special about it?

- written from scratch, no additional libraries
- Responsive
- All the projects information loads dynamically from a javascript object
  - I wrote a class to handle all the keys that each project may contain
    ```
    // single project
    {
      name:,
      siteUrl: ,
      videoUrl: ,
      repoUrl: ,
      description: ,
      tools: []
    },
    ```
  - [Take a look at the js file](https://github.com/pavel6767/pavel6767.github.io/blob/master/src/app.js)
